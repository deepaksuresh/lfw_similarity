# lfw_similarity
1. The file `load_saved.py` accepts two images. It'll process them and give you a similarity score as well as binary output
2. I have used `Inception_ResNetV2`, which comes with `tf.keras`
3. Data augmentation has been done in the script `data_feeder.py`, preprocessing is also done here
4. The model hasn't been trained properly, so you'll find its performance/accuracy to be not great
